# Lua Colorblindness Visualizer

A small library that can be used to apply colorblindness filters on images. Used mostly as an inside joke in one of the communities I frequent.

This project is only possible thanks to https://ixora.io/projects/colorblindness/color-blindness-simulation-research/, from where I copied all the matrixes from.


## Installation

Coming to [lit](https://luvit.io/lit.html) and [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/) soon (hopefully).

Depends on [vips-utils](https://github.com/RiskoZoSlovenska/lua-vips-utils), and on either [lua-vips](https://github.com/libvips/lua-vips) or [lit-vips](https://github.com/bilal2453/lit-vips).


## TODO
